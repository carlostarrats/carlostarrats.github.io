        <!-- Content -->
        <div class="detail-content">
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Current website limits businesses ability to service the customer timely & effectively while not aligning to the brand mission, which is: fashion is transformative.</p>

          <h2>The Goal</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">How might we provide an efficient and enjoyable shopping experience that is reflective of ELOQUII as a company, as well as build trust with new customers.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">The Before ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-2.jpg" alt="Original Eloquii website homepage showing outdated design and limited functionality">
          </div>

          <h2>Initial Research</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Customers were scrolling down the page but were not clicking through toward the end of the header slider. The drop-off past the first image was significant with the following image / marketing not having visibility.</p>

          <h2>Business Feedback</h2>
          <ul class="detail-text">
            <li>&ldquo;We would love more flexibility and ownership; making small changes requires too many teams&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;The site doesn't look fashionable&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Communicating who we are to the customer is challenging with so little real estate&rdquo;</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Where Customers Shop ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-3.jpg" alt="Customer shopping behavior analysis showing preferred browsing patterns">
          </div>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Develop a design that is modular and easily editable with an increased number of assets, a mobile friendly experience, and a UI specific to the brand that appeals to users.</p>

          <!--h2>User Story</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">As a customer coming to ELOQUII I want to understand what the company sells and if there is product I like.</p-->

          <!--h2>Key Solution Elements</h2>
          <ul class="detail-text">
            <li>Flexibility: allow for business to easily edit relevant business propositions and manage assets without design and dev.</li>
            <li>Imagery: expand the content and the businesses ability to communicate with the customer allowing the clothing more visibility.</li>
            <li>A clean UI: a visual system that aligns to the brand DNA while also being accessible to customers across a range of specific personas.</li>
          </ul-->

          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">We looked at a range of typefaces used within fashion as well as some outside of. Ultimately through feedback from customers and internal alignment to the brand we settled on Futura by Paratype and Austin by Commercial Type.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Typography & Design System ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-4.jpg" alt="Eloquii typography system and design language featuring Futura and Austin typefaces">
          </div>

          <h2>Imagery</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">We looked at ways imagery could be re-sized to both show the clothing in the imagery more fully and have more consistency from placement to placement.<br><br>We did variations and put them in front of customers for feedback. Customers liked having horizontal and vertical sizing for both a break in format and clarity of the images.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Initial Ideas ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-5.jpg" alt="Early mockups of Eloquii website layout options and grid systems">
          </div>

          <h2>Refinement</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">During our interviews we found that a certain set of customers would visit the site everyday looking for newness and this need was not being met. So we came up with a "take-over" layout for sales and event days.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Homepage - Idea ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-6.jpg" alt="Conceptual homepage design with prominent hero image and modular content areas">
          </div>

           <h3 class="with-arrow">Non-Takeover vs. Takeover ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-8.jpg" alt="Flexible header slot showcasing special collection and sale banner options">
          </div>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Final Design - Homepage (Non-Takeover) ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-7.jpg" alt="Final Eloquii homepage redesign with improved content modules and visual hierarchy">
          </div>

         
          <h2>Top Nav With Image Support</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">To better illustrate categories and put business highlighted product out front with a direct click-through, flexible images slots were introduced within a new drop-down desktop nav. The slots can hold one horizontal image or 3 vertical.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Final Design ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-9.jpg" alt="Navigation dropdown menus with integrated product imagery and category visuals">
          </div>

          <h2>Messaging Slots</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Sales and shipping are a big point of focus for conversion for the brand. As such we established a flexible slot controlled by the business team. The slot is able to hold 3, 2, or 1 "box" with the 1 being a rotating message of up to 3 messages if desired. Mobile and tablet automatically default to the 1 box rotating messages regardless of the desktop experience. In addition, on scroll the slot is sticky across desktop, tablet, and mobile for full visibility site-wide to drive urgency.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Final Design ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-10.jpg" alt="Sticky messaging bar with promotional content and shipping information">
          </div>

          <h2>Brand Communication</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">There was a need for the ability to communicate the who, what, and why of the brand. To do more than just sell product, but highlight the culture that exists around ELOQUII and their customers by promoting a sense of community.<br><br>We established a brand dedicated section owned by brand marketing with these slots typically featuring brand news, customer profiles, events, editorialized fashion tips and so on. When clicked each article opens a side tray through which the content is available in-window. The blog was re-branded and designed on a more user friendly platform with better site integration to enable 100% brand marketing ownership without the need for any creative resources which was previously required.</p>

          <h3 class="with-arrow">Final Design ↓</h3>
          <div class="detail-image" data-aos="fade-up">
            <img src="images/detail-eloquii-11.jpg" alt="Brand communication section featuring editorial content and customer stories">
          </div>

          <h2>Business Impact</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">In the end, by building out a more flexible page it allowed business to react in real time by adjusting creative and messaging as needed while improving team wide productivity, providing users with a more streamlined user experience which led to increased customer click-through, conversion, and improved accessibility.<br><br>Things to look at: personalization, smarter widgets, easier sign-in, and a more integrated social media experience.</p>

          <h2>*Update</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Walmart has since sold ELOQUII to a lower market fashion portfolio company with much of the existing work I led being fit into their existing framework.</p>
