        <div class="detail-content">
          <p class="detail-text">LoCA is a start-up connecting artists, spaces, and buyers.</p>
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Buying art can be an intimidating experience with barriers for artists in both showing
            their work and selling it.</p>

          <h2>The Goal</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">How might we lower barriers for artists bringing more visibility to their work while
            making it easy to purchase in person.</p>

          <h2>The Why</h2>
          <ul class="detail-text">
            <li>For artists: easily connect with spaces interested in them.</li>
            <li>For spaces: support local artists and add value to their environment.</li>
            <li>For buyers: support local artists and easily purchase outside of the gallery environment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who Are The Potential Buyers</h2>
          <ul class="detail-text">
            <li>Local art enthusiast: user who is interested in art and has purchased art in the past.</li>
            <li>Art engaged: inspired by art but has not purchased original art previously.</li>
            <li>Non art purchasers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Implement a process that connects users in spaces directly with product through a
            quick, direct, cost-effective and scaleable process by the use of QR codes.</p>

          <h2>User Stories</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">Artists: as an artist, I want to easily connect with spaces and sell to buyers, so that
            I can gain exposure and fund further artwork.
            <br><br>
            Spaces: as a business, I want to both support local artists as well as add value to my empty walls, so that
            I can be seen as an engaged member of the community.
            <br><br>
            Buyers: as someone interested in purchasing art, I want to quickly and easily make a purchase, so that I can
            support local artists and own a unique art piece.
          </p>

        </div>

          <h2>Refinement</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">During our interviews we found that users needed more cues to understand the artworks
            were shopable, where to go to learn more and find a way to circle back to the artwork when they leave the
            business and forget the artist's name.
            <br><br>
            The solves were to add forms of payment, bolding and enlarging the web address, and building out a city page
            that highlights the artists currently in show and is easy to remember / write down.
          </p>

          <h2>Business Impact</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">We have since launched and are in V2 looking toward V3, V4, and so on. We are also
            collecting data, continuing to gather feedback, and figure out market fit while using our resources as best
            we can.
            <br><br>
            Things to look at: further optimization of the experience, with further resources, re-look at other
            technology, improving workflow with contract developers, and figuring out a way to better test in real
            locations.
          </p>

          <h2>*Update</h2>
          <p class="detail-text">LoCA has struggled to find market fit and while still operational, has paused all
            development.</p>
