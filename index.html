      I’ve spent the last 3 years working for the Defense Digital Service within the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office inside the Department of Defense. Alongside software engineers, data scientists, and product managers, I have been
      designing products and consulting on a range of projects that fall within my organizations mandate to deliver better services to the warfighter through design & technology. Before joining the DoD I worked for both 0-1 start-ups and large
      corporations like Amazon.
      <br><br>
      Through it all I have been challenged to grow as a designer, manager, and teammate. I lead with empathy to drive
      results through user-centric design while championing growth within my teams. In a previous life I seriously
      pursued art, having been published and represented as well as had gallery shows in Baltimore, Atlanta, Santa
      Fe, Los Angeles, New York, and the Netherlands.
      <br><br>
     If you are looking for a design portfolio, due to the nature of my work for the Department of Defense, visuals are not available to the public and what I can say is limited. Because of this, the portfolio I do have is a few years old. All that said, let's talk. For more information on my current work, please visit <a href="https://www.dds.mil">dds.mil</a> to learn about my organization and feel free to contact me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-t-b869016">LinkedIn</a>
