    <br>
    <p>

      I’ve spent the last almost 3 years working within the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office inside the
      Department of Defense alongside software engineers, data scientists, and product managers where I have been
      designing products and consulting on a range of projects that fall within my organizations mandate to deliver better services to the warfighter through design & technology. Before joining the federal workforce I worked for both 0-1 start-ups and large
      corporations like Amazon.
      <br><br>
      Through it all I have been challenged to grow as a designer, manager, and teammate. I lead with empathy to drive
      results through user-centric design while championing growth within my teams. In a previous life I seriously
      pursued art, having been published and represented as well as had gallery shows in Baltimore, Atlanta, Santa
      Fe, Los Angeles, New York, and the Netherlands.
      <br><br>
     If you are looking for a portfolio of my work. Let's talk. Due to the nature of my recent work for the Department of Defense which, for the most part, is not available to the public there is only so much I can say. Because of this what I can show is mostly a portfolio a few years old. That said let's talk. For more information on my current work, please visit <a href="https://www.dds.mil">dds.mil</a> to learn about my organization and feel free to contact me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-t-b869016">LinkedIn</a>
