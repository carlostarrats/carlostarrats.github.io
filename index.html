      <br><br>
      For the past three years, I've been working with the Defense Digital Service, part of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office within the Department of Defense. In collaboration with software engineers, data scientists, and product managers, I have designed products and consulted across various projects aimed at delivering better services to the warfighter through design & technology. Prior to joining the DoD, I gained experience at both early-stage start-ups and large corporations, including Amazon.
      <br><br>
      Due to the sensitive nature of my work with the Department of Defense, I'm unable to share current visuals or detailed information publicly. As a result, my <a href="https://carlostarrats.github.io/work">portfolio</a> is a few years old. However, I'm happy to discuss my experience and how I can contribute to any potential needs within the limits of what I can share. Let's connect!
      <br><br>
